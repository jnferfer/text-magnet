This is a tool for **exploring hidden connections within a set of texts**. Version 1.0 serves as a demo using simple medical texts to showcase the functionality of our TextMagnet reasoning engine. Based on Natural Language Processing, this engine automatically identifies relationships within a set of approximately 1000 texts. In Version 2.0, users will be able to upload their own text files to investigate how they relate to each other, addressing use cases such as:

- Discovering new ideas.
- Contrasting facts narrated from different perspectives.
- Verifying data from a questionable source against reliable sources.

Our goal is to build an generic engine that facilitates contrasting ideas in large datasets **to combat misinformation or exponentially increase knowledge on a specific topic**.

### Usage Instructions
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
1. Select the title of a document from the left dropdown menu.
"""

text3 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
2. The browser displays the text corresponding to the selected title. Sentences underscored in the text have links to other sentences in different texts expressing similar ideas
"""

text4 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
3. Click on any of these sentences to reveal a graph of related ideas. Explore this graph to see which ideas related to the selected phrase TextMagnet has discovered
"""

text5 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
4. Related ideas are logically grouped in the graph, using a label that describes the type of relationship between the compared ideas. Currently, the set of logical relationships includes: Equivalents, Causes, Consequences, Similarities, Additionally, Examples, Interventions (as treatments), Opposites. "Similarities" is the most generic and frequent. This set of relationships will be refined in parallel with the development of the reasoning engine
"""

text6 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
5. Hover the mouse over each node to see a measure of distance (cosine distance) between the two compared sentences. The comparison is more reliable with a smaller distance.
"""

text7 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
6. Click on each node in the graph to go to an excerpt of the related text. The related sentence is marked in blue. This excerpt has a link to the full text.
"""

text8 = """
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
7. The "History" section stores the texts that have been consulted during the session.
